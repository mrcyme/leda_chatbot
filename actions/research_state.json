To improve the existing business approach by implementing modern technologies, the client needed a healthcare application integrated with the IoT and AI solutions to improve working conditions for employees and boost the efficiency of services. The Client was looking for experts in the AI software development field.\nChallenge: enhance IoT healthcare application with AI\n\nAs an experienced provider of AI software development services, InData Labs was challenged to train a machine learning (ML) model to augment the Client\u2019s existing solution. Our engineering team was tasked to build a model able to efficiently process large amounts of historical data and data gathered from wearable devices to create and deliver data-based push notifications for iOS as the output.\n\nThe IoT component was a wristband that measured a driver\u2019s heart rate before and during each trip. This data wasn\u2019t enough for a reliable evaluation of health status. For systemizing and crunching more data, the existing solution required an additional ML-based model.\nSolution: ML model to process several types of data and generate personalized notifications\n\nThe IoT healthcare application is intended for drivers of commercial vehicles having health problems. Preventing emergency cases is a part of the business owner\u2019s employee care and expense management program.\n\nThe InData Labs\u2019 team started with scrutinizing the existing solution. Our AI research and development experts dived into the capabilities of the existing app to come up with the best ways to enhance it.\n\nApart from the data collected via wristbands, we fetched the following types of data to the model as the input:\n\n    Driver\u2019s heart rate\n    Driver\u2019s gender and age\n    Historical heart rate data\n    Weather information\n    Time of day\n    Route & destination\n\nThe gathered data was fed into the Client\u2019s database for further processing. So, the following data sources were used to get the input for the ML-model:\n\nML model to process several types of data\n\nBased on the comprehensive input data, we trained the model to perform the following tasks:\n\n    Analyze the health status of drivers\n    Detect health problems\n    Generate push notifications\n    Send alerts and recommendations to drivers\n\nThe algorithm splits the received output into the 3 categories or zones. Depending on one or another category, different push notifications and recommendations are sent to drivers from the server. The examples are the following:\n\nML model to generate personalized notifications\n\nTo complete the task, the InData Labs\u2019 team used the Apple Push Notification service (APNs) to enable the remote notifications feature. Our team also used the Client\u2019s service to store and process data.\nResult: ML-powered expense management solution, cost reduction as a result of processes automation\n\nThe InData Labs\u2019 team successfully delivered the ML model that allowed the merging of IoT and AI to enhance the Client\u2019s healthcare application.

While there are various ways to do AI-based quality inspection, automated optical inspection is by far the largest sub-category.\n\nAutomated optical inspection is a technique where a camera autonomously scans the device under test for catastrophic failure (e.g. missing component) and/or quality defects (e.g. fillet size or shape or component skew). Computer vision is the foundation of optical inspection. Once the images are recognized, semi-supervised ML is the most effective technique to classify images into failure classes. The main benefit of this use case is cost reduction, and the main potential beneficiaries are large manufacturing facilities, where a small reduction in scrap or test time can yield very large savings.\n\nCost implications: after implementing optical inspection on one of its plants, BOSCH claimed to achieve $1.3M savings due to 45% of total test time reduction. Source: BOSCH.\n\n    Example: A major German automotive company is introducing a deep learning-enabled system for quality control. This system is fully integrated into the flow of the final assembly process and thereby gets rid of the need to have a separate testing area in a controlled environment. The solution is expected to soon replace conventional camera booths that are used today and according to the OEM will result in \u201cimmense savings\u201d.\n", "source": "https://iot-analytics.com/the-top-10-industrial-ai-use-cases/"}, {"text": "OCR to Recognize and Extract Data from Driver\u2019s Licenses, ID Books, and Smart Cards\n\n\nImproved recognition accuracy up to 90%.\n\n    Challenge\n    Identifying and deriving sensitive data from image scans and facilitating document-based processes\n    Solution\n    OCR-based solution to capture and retrieve data from document scans automatically\n    Technologies and tools\n    Python PyTorch Tesseract Opencv\n\nClient\n\nThe client is a South African content management solution provider that works with the key players in the banking industry of the country. The client\u2019s main objective is to assist companies in capturing and managing data assets in order to improve operational efficiency. To accomplish this, they integrate different automation toolkits.\n\nThis case study will highlight our expertise in computer vision and the importance of OCR when dealing with document scans.\nChallenge: capture and derive data from document scans and facilitate document workflow\n\nThe client deals with large volumes of data on a regular basis. Manual data search and its recognition from ID books, smart cards, driver\u2019s licenses or any other documents are time-consuming and tedious. That\u2019s why the client was looking for automated data capture and extraction solution. They needed an expert opinion on integrating OCR into their ERP system to handle critical business functions. But the primary objective was to leverage data from document scans and reduce its manual processing and entry because it was taking much time.\n\nThe major challenge for our team was to capture and retrieve data from photo scans that often vary in orientations, positions, colours, backgrounds, and lighting conditions. We delivered a service that helps recognize objects in the image scans and determine what data needs to be derived.\nSolution: OCR-based solution to automate data capture and extraction from document scans\n\nHaving broad experience in OCR implementation, the InData Labs team provided the client with a custom-made solution that helps automate data-based business processes in the client\u2019s workplace and improve the overall work performance.\n\nOur team investigated the feasibility of extracting and recognizing text fields such as name, surname, ID, valid from/to from driver\u2019s licenses from DMV databases, business cards, ID books, and smart cards using OCR. When it comes to leveraging data, these types of documents are uneasy to deal with. In this case, facial recognition comes to aid and helps derive data from damaged driver\u2019s licenses or blurred ID books.\n\nThe next step was finding out how to use facial recognition to identify an individuals face in their driver\u2019s license photo or any other document scan. We started developing image pre-processing functionality that significantly improved the efficiency of a commercial built-in OCR engine by automated cropping, rotation and deskewing. We also advanced the existing document classifier to distinguish 3 types of documents: a smart card, ID book, and a driver\u2019s license. We split this process into two phases: image normalization and field recognition.\n\n1. Image normalization\n\nThe main challenge for the OCR engines is to recognize rotated, skewed, darkened and blurred scans as well as photo scans with a complex background that usually leads to misunderstanding and errors. To mitigate that, we trained a model to capture a document, crop it, and deskew an image. This phase significantly improved default pipeline recognition. As a result, we got a document without any background positioned correctly.\n\n2. Field recognition\n\nThe next task was to capture and identify the required fields in the normalized image. To complete this, our data scientists trained another ML model that predicts where exactly the particular field is located. Having the precise location of the required fields they could crop them from the normalized image and identify them independently. That gave our team more freedom in preprocessing and optimizing the performance of the OCR engine.\n\nTo recognize the required fields we applied Tesseract OCR or Captiva built-in OCR engines.\n\nTake a closer look at the OCR use case diagram:\n\nOCR use case diagram\nResult: OCR data capture and extraction solution to reduce manual effort\n\nHaving extensive technical expertise in developing image recognition solutions, our engineers have delivered a robust solution that automatically captures and derives sensitive data from driver\u2019s licenses, ID books, and smart cards and increases the overall operational efficiency in the client\u2019s workplace.\n\nOur solution enables the processing of a document scan in 2 seconds. 4 document scans can be processed simultaneously.
